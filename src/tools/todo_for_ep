Make sure that the following is done when necessary at the opening before calling read_ep_internal
    CALL set_ctlsize(td_ep, il_nctl)
    td_ep%i_ctl_lev = il_ctl_lev

replace call to
		read_ctl_size_internal
by

    CALL set_ctlsize(td_ep, il_nctl)
    td_ep%i_ctl_lev = il_ctl_lev


Check read_ctl_internal and write_ctl_internal and make sure that anyone is used at the right place
Also check read_dctl_internal and write_dctl_internal
